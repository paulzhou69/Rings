Modern Cooperative Time Management Checklist with Rings Visualization 

## About 
The checklist has been around for millennia and it is about time that it was reinvented for the modern-day! The old checklist is only available to one person, and can no longer efficiently function under todayâ€™s increasingly connected society. A cooperative checklist with a visual representation of information is urgently needed. 

Our app, Rings, presents all your tasks in an easy-to-view visualization with rings that keep deadlines in focus. As deadlines for a certain task approach, its ring shortens. With just a quick glance, you can keep you and your team hyper-aware and on task. Rings is unique in its social aspect - what we offer is a collaborative solution to time management. You can allow friends to view some of your tasks so that you get a friendly reminder instead of an easy-to-dismiss notification.
